  ## Description
  The reason I made this project was to build a backend database using Express.js and Sequelize to run APIs to show, modify, add, and delete data in the database. This will be an easier way to build databases and work on them without having to go into MySQL server to fix and audit inforamtion.

  ## Usage
  ![alttext](./assets/images/{add name of picture here})
  This project makes it easier for an e-commerce website to maintain its databases. They can prefor API get, post, put, and delete calls to adjust whatever needs to fixed , added, or deleted all in one place without having to know all of the table information. They only need to get the ID of what needs to be done and fix it from an API call. They also only need the category name or product name to add new inforamtion to the database.
